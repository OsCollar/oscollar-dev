#### Requirements

Simulator: 0.9.3.1 or newer
or
Dreamgrid: 7.04 or newer

- Teleporting to a sim running older versions of OpenSim may result in loss of settings (linkset data) and loss of functionality (non-running scripts)
- Teleporting to a hypergrid sim may result in scripts to stop running and/or reset, unless the destination sim is patched

To avoid problems, the general advice is to only use this on your home grid meeting the minimal requirements or better.
